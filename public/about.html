  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <hr />
  
  <p>I am an English and coding student in Brazil, and this is actually my first portfolio. I'm super excited 
  to tell you all about my journey up to this point!</p>

  <p>I've studied for a long time at a school a little far from my house, so I had to take a bus every day, 
  except on Saturdays and Sundays. Well, in my last year at Pio XII, I was quite worried about the Enem, which is a Brazilian 
  national high school exam. It is used to get into college based on your exam score.</p>

  <p>Obviously, because of fear, I ended up without a high enough score to get into Ufes, the university in my state, 
  to study Architecture. Although I missed that opportunity, I didn’t give up. I’ve been taking advantage of my free time 
  to study English and coding. Fortunately, I can afford a private college, so I enrolled in Uvv, where I’ll 
  study Computer Science, and I’m very excited to start.</p>

  <p>Yeah, I confess, I used ChatGPT to review my spelling mistakes, but I’m learning, and I believe I’m improving. Thank you 
  for reading! I appreciate it.</p>
